Week 1

The group was formed. I did some research on the topics and chose the film finder topic.
Then I did some study on which framework to use, and learned some basic knowledge about Vue, React, Flask and SQLite.
Finally I looked into the websites related to the topic like Netflix, RottenTomatos etc. and found some drawbacks.

Week 2

This week I worked mainly on the proposal.
I wrote part of the user stories about user: film critics.
I wrote the background part of the proposal.
I also learned some details about Flask so that I can have a better understanding of the software architecture.
Next week the proposal should be finished and we need to start working on the website now.
