	<h1>About Page</h1>
	<p style="text-indent:2em;">People these days are more likely to find movies to watch online instead of 
    going to the cinema. here are many websites that can feed costumers with functions like searching movies, 
    rating, and commenting them. FilmFinder is a web platform for finding movies you like with the aid of our 
    recommendation system and it comes with additional features that other sites lack.</p>
    <ul>Below is the full list of FilmFinder features:
      <br><br>
      <li>User authentication.</li>
      <li>Basic search for certain movies and advanced search that can let user filter out results.
      </li>
      <li>Recommend movies based on user’s rating history(both User-Based Collaborate Filtering and Item-Based Collaborate Filtering). 
      </li>
      <li>Wishlist and Blocklist.
      </li>
      <li>Leave comments and rate movies.
      </li>
      <li>'Like' a review.
      </li>

      </li>

      </li>
      <p style="text-indent:2em;">The system architecture can be divided into 3 layers: the presentation, 
        business, and data layers. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent:2em;">The presentation layer is presented by serval html pages where user 
          can interact with, to achieve some functions like searching for movies, 
          getting recommendation info, leaving comments, adding movies to wish list, 
          and blocking some other users. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent:2em;">
          The business logic layer is the bound between presentation layer and the 
          database. This layer receives data from the frontend, the presentation 
          layer via http requests and send data back to presentation layer or to 
          the database, determined by different functions. For example, if user 
          search for a certain movie, then the business layer will get the data 
          like genre or director in the form of http post, and then change it 
          to SQL query form and then query in the database. Finally, the business 
          layer will get the result in a dictionary and send back to presentation 
          layer. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent:2em;">
          The data access layer contains a database called 'filmfinder.db', a poster 
          images folder, and a user profile image folder. The operations in the 
          presentation layer will be transferred to operations in the data layer 
          by the business layer. Also, presentation layer can directly get posters 
          from poster images folder without any help from the business layer. The 
          filmfinder database is generated from 2 csv files downloaded from 
          Kaggle.com. The poster images are also downloaded from Kaggle.com.
